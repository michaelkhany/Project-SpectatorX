# Project SpectatorX
## Introduction
  Project SpectatorX includes three main branches: Image processing, Image recreation, Image perception. The sub-projects will be sorted by those three branches. It started to gather the developers and scientists code, researches and algorithms those stands by explainable artificial intelligence to make image perception possible for machine systems. The project started on Jan 2020 by En. Michael Bidollahkhany, and goes public on march 2020 after its initial release party(Introducing Recogeometries application and algorithm.

## Mission
  The project mainly aimed to develop a light-weight, precise and multifunctional image perception algorithms based on explainable artificial intelligence for the developers and researchers, to push the edges of xAI based science and technologies.
